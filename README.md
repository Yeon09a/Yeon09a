### Hi there 👋 I'm Yeona
Hi, I’m Yeona Kim, a game developer who continually strives to improve in order to create games that players can genuinely care about.
I am currently part of a team developing an indie multiplayer game in Unity, strengthening my skills through hands-on experience and self-driven learning.

I share the thoughts, challenges, and insights I gain throughout the development process, and aim to learn from diverse perspectives through discussion.

Alongside development, I am also actively improving my English and Japanese to engage more deeply with global development resources and perspectives.
